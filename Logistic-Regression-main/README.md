- Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. 
- So it forms an “S” shaped curve.
- Sigmoid fun removes the effect of outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1.

#### Advantages

- Highly efficient
- Doesn't require high computation power
- Easy to implement, easily interpretable
- It doesn't require scaling of features.
- Logistic regression provides a probability score for observations.

#### Disadvantages

- Logistic regression cannot handle a large number of categorical features/variables.
- It is vulnerable to overfitting.
- It can't solve the non-linear problem with the logistic regression which is why it requires a transformation of non-linear features.
- Logistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other.

- We are getting the Correct Output. 
- Hence Our Model has accurately classified its dependent Variable.
