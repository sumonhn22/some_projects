## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
Starbucks is a growing brand and I myself not being a coffee lover, i have been inquisitive about what attracts so many customers to the doors of Startbucks everyday with so many updates on instagram aswell. Through this Udacity Nanodegree program, this project motivated me to get a deeper understanding about its customers and promotional campaigns. This project has been a great oppurtunity to study the brand using its real-life data and improve my Data Science skills.

## 3. Run the project <a name="files"></a>  
From the repository,Download the jupyter notebook file - [Customer_Segmentation-Starbucks_Capstone.ipynb](https://github.com/krantiw/Customer-Segmentation-Of-Starbucks/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_Starbucks_Capstone.ipynb) and the 3 data files.
- Open the ananconda commond windown n open the jupyter browser on your local:http://localhost:8889/tree
- Click on the downloaded jupyter file n run it to see the resuls

## 4. Conclusion and Results <a name="results"></a>  
Conclusion:
Segmentation of startbucks Customers:
The customers can be segmented depending on various parameters according to the campaign chosen
On analysis the data using supervised and unsupervised learning(Kmeans), we can conclude that:
Different segments of customers react to offers differently.
The count of male customers in low-income level is slightly higher than that of female and other customers
Though the aveage salary of femal is greater than that of the male, female spend less on starbucks than male
Starbucks has more of the young crowd than those of the aged once.
The result of the offer_type was prediced by training a supervised classifier.
Results:-
Customers are attracted to BOGO and Discount offers more as compared to Informational Offers
The buying behaviour of a customer is indepemdent of its annual income
Starbucks have more male customers than females and other gender.
KNeighborsClassifier turned out to be the best algorithm for this task and predicts customer response with an accuracy rate of almost 93% after hyperarameter tuning. Given the fact that also the same customer will react differently the same offer.
